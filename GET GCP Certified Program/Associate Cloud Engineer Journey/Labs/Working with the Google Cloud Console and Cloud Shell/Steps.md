## Overview

In this lab, you become familiar with the Google Cloud web-based interface. There are two integrated environments: a GUI (graphical user interface) environment called the Cloud Console, and a CLI (command-line interface) called Cloud Shell. In this lab, you use both environments.

Here are a few things you need to know about the Cloud Console:

* The Cloud Console is under continuous development, so occasionally the graphical layout changes. This is most often to accommodate new Google Cloud features or changes in the technology, resulting in a slightly different workflow.
* You can perform most common Google Cloud actions in the Cloud Console, but not all actions. In particular, very new technologies or sometimes detailed API or command options are not implemented (or not yet implemented) in the Cloud Console. In these cases, the command line or the API is the best alternative.
* The Cloud Console is extremely fast for some activities. The Cloud Console can perform multiple actions on your behalf that might require many CLI commands. It can also perform repetitive actions. In a few clicks you can accomplish activities that would require a lot of typing and would be susceptible to typing errors.
* The Cloud Console is able to reduce errors by offering only valid options through its menus. It can leverage access to the platform "behind the scenes" through the SDK to validate configuration before submitting changes. A command line can't do this kind of dynamic validation.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

* Get access to Google Cloud.
* Use the Cloud Console to create a Cloud Storage bucket.
* Use Cloud Shell to create a Cloud Storage bucket.
* Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

### Qwiklabs setup

For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

1. Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an incognito window.
2. Note the lab's access time (for example, ![img/time.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/aZQJ4BT7uCmM9XR6BTXgTRP1Hfu1T7q6V%2BcnbdEsbpU%3D) and make sure you can finish in that time block.[Cloud Shell Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs).

Note: After 1 hour of inactivity, the Cloud Shell instance is recycled. Only the /home directory persists. Any changes made to the system configuration, including environment variables, are lost between sessions.

### Open Cloud Shell and explore features

1. In the Google Cloud menu, click Activate Cloud Shell (![Activate Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ep8HmqYGdD%2FkUncAAYpV47OYoHwC8%2Bg0WK%2F8sidHquE%3D)). If prompted, click Continue. Cloud Shell opens at the bottom of the Cloud Console window.

There are three buttons on the far right of the Cloud Shell toolbar:

![three icons on far right of Cloud Shell toolbar](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/xHKpKKTXWBkXrdrB1yYpaJETcizw6kdzaLuO5%2FzddbU%3D)
  * Minimize/Restore: The first one minimizes or restores the window, giving you full access to the Cloud Console without closing Cloud Shell.
  * Open in a new window: Having Cloud Shell at the bottom of the Cloud Console is useful when you are issuing individual commands. However, sometimes you will be editing files or want to see the full output of a command. For these uses, this button pops the Cloud Shell out into a full-sized terminal window.
  * Close terminal: This button closes Cloud Shell. Every time you close Cloud Shell, the virtual machine is reset and all machine context is lost.
2. Close Cloud Shell now.

Cloud Shell provides you with which of the following? (Select all that apply).

Command-line access to a free temporary Compute Engine VM

5 GB of persistent storage (/home)

A command-line tool that requires you to install Cloud SDK

Built-in authorization for access to resources and instances

## Task 3\. Use Cloud Shell to create a Cloud Storage bucket

### Create a second bucket and verify in the Cloud Console

1. Open Cloud Shell again.
2. Use the gsutil command to create another bucket. Replace <BUCKET\_NAME\> with a globally unique name (you can append a 2 to the globally unique bucket name you used previously):

    gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

Copied!

1. If prompted, click Authorize.
2. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D)), click Cloud Storage \> Browser, or click Refresh if you are already in the Storage browser. The second bucket should be displayed in the Buckets list.

Note: You have performed equivalent actions using the Cloud Console and Cloud Shell. You created a bucket using the Cloud Console and another bucket using Cloud Shell.

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective.

## Task 4\. Explore more Cloud Shell features

### Upload a file

1. Open Cloud Shell.
2. Click the More button (![More button](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/2ufrDePg5inKfodUoT2Kib4oE7II7emYn%2BypCC85FjQ%3D)) in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.
3. Click Upload. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. This file will be referred to as \[MY\_FILE\].
4. In Cloud Shell, type `ls` to confirm that the file was uploaded.
5. Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace \[MY\_FILE\] with the file you uploaded and \[BUCKET\_NAME\] with one of your bucket names:

    gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

Copied!

If your filename has whitespaces, be sure to place single quotes around the filename. For example, `gsutil cp â€˜my file.txt' gs://[BUCKET_NAME]`

Note: You have uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to a bucket.

1. Explore the options available in Cloud Shell by clicking on different icons in the Cloud Shell toolbar.
2. Close all the Cloud Shell sessions.

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective.

## Task 5\. Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

In this section you will learn a best practice for using Cloud Shell. The gcloud command often requires you to specify values such as a Region, Zone, or Project ID. Entering them repeatedly increases the chance of making typing errors. If you use Cloud Shell frequently, you may want to set common values in environment variables and use them instead of typing the actual values.

### Identify available regions

1. Open Cloud Shell from the Cloud Console. Note that this allocates a new VM for you.
2. To list available regions, execute the following command:

    gcloud compute regions list

Copied!

1. Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor. This region will now be referred to as \[YOUR\_REGION\] in the remainder of the lab.

### Create and verify an environment variable

1. Create an environment variable and replace \[YOUR\_REGION\] with the region you selected in the previous step:

    INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

Copied!

1. Verify it with echo:

    echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

Copied!

You can use environment variables like this in gcloud commands to reduce the opportunities for typos and so that you won't have to remember a lot of detailed information.

Note: Every time you close Cloud Shell and reopen it, a new VM is allocated, and the environment variable you just set disappears. In the next steps, you create a file to set the value so that you won't have to enter the command each time Cloud Shell is reset.

### Append the environment variable to a file

1. Create a subdirectory for materials used in this lab:

    mkdir infraclass

Copied!

1. Create a file called `config` in the infraclass directory:

    touch infraclass/config

Copied!

1. Append the value of your Region environment variable to the `config` file:

    echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

Copied!

1. Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing \[YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID\] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

    INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

Copied!

1. Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the `config` file:

    echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

Copied!

1. Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

    source infraclass/config echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

Copied!

[Disabling or Resetting Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/resetting-cloud-shell). This will cause everything in your Cloud Shell environment to be set back to its original default state.

To create a persistent state in Cloud Shell, which file would you configure?

.config

.profile

.my\_variables

.bashrc

## Task 6\. Review the Google Cloud interface

Cloud Shell is an excellent interactive environment for exploring Google Cloud by using Google Cloud SDK commands like `gcloud` and `gsutil`.

You can install the Google Cloud SDK on a computer or on a VM instance in Google Cloud. The gcloud and gsutil commands can be automated by using a scripting language like bash (Linux) or Powershell (Windows). You can also explore using the command-line tools in Cloud Shell, and then use the parameters as an implementation guide in the SDK using one of the supported languages.

The Google Cloud interface consists of two parts: the Cloud Console and Cloud Shell.

The Console:

* Provides a fast way to perform tasks.
* Presents options to you, instead of requiring you to know them.
* Performs behind-the-scenes validation before submitting the commands.

Cloud Shell provides:

* Detailed control
* A complete range of options and features
* A path to automation through scripting
