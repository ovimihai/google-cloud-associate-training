# Cloud Storage

- Scalable to exabytes
- Time to first byte in milliseconds
- Very high availability across all storage classes
- Single API across storage classes

- Not a file system, just a key-value store

## Storage Classes
- Standard
    - for hot data
    - most expensive
    - for a brief period
    - no retrieving cost
- Nearline > 30d
    - backups, long-tail multimedia
    - cost for data access
- Coldline > 90d
    - lower cost for infrequent access
- Archive > 1y
    - lowest cost
    - available in miliseconds but higher cost for access

Durability: 11 nines durable  (metaphor: money is in the bank, but not necessarily available)

Availability SLQ:
- Standard 
    - multi/dual - 99.95%
    - region - 99.90%
- Nearline & Coldline
    - multi/dual - 99.90%
    - region 99.00%
- Archive - NO SLA

## Storage Types
- Multi-region
- Dual region
- Region

## Overview

- Buckets
    - Naming requirements
    - Cannot be nested
- Objects
    - Inherit storage class of bucket when created
    - No minimum size; unlimited storage
- Access
    - gsutil command
    - REST API

Changing default storage classes
- Default class is applied to new objects.
- Regional bucket can never be changed to multi-region/dual-region.
- Multi-regional bucket can never be changed to regional.
- Objects can be moved from bucket to bucket.
- Object Lifecycle Management can manage the classes of **objects**.

### Access control lists (ACLs)
- more detailed control
- max 100 ACL entries / bucket
- Who -> What
- special users
    - allUsers - everyone on the internet
    - allAuthenticatedUsers - everyone authenticated with a google account

Signed URLs
- “Valet key” access to buckets and objects via ticket:
    - Ticket is a cryptographically signed URL
    - Time-limited
    - Operations specified in ticket: HTTP GET, PUT, DELETE (not POST)
    - Any user with URL can invoke permitted operations
- Example using private account key and gsutil: 
    - `gsutil signurl -d 10m path/to/privatekey.p12 gs://bucket/object`

### Data import services
- **Transfer Appliance**: Rack, capture and then ship your data to Google Cloud.
- **Storage Transfer Service**: Import online data (another bucket, an S3 bucket, or web source).
- **Offline Media Import**: Third-party provider uploads the data from physical media.

Cloud Storage provides strong global consistency
- Read-after-write
- Read-after-metadata-update
- Read-after-delete
- Bucket listing
- Object listing
