# Infrastructure Automation

## Infrastructure as code (IaC) allows quick provisioning and removing of infrastructures
- Build an infrastructure when needed.
- Destroy the infrastructure when not in use. 
- Create identical infrastructures for dev, test, and prod. 
- Can be part of a CI/CD pipeline. 
- Templates are the building blocks for disaster recovery procedures. 
- Manage resource dependencies and complexity. 
- Google Cloud supports many IaC tools.


```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Network example
```
# Create the mynetwork network
resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork" {
name = "mynetwork"
# RESOURCE properties go here
auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
}
```

Firewall rule
```
# Create the mynetwork network
resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork" {
name = "mynetwork"
# RESOURCE properties go here
auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
}
# Add a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP and ICMP traffic on mynetwork
resource "google_compute_firewall" "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp" {
name = "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp"
# RESOURCE properties go here
network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22", "80", "3389"]
    }
allow {
    protocol = "icmp"
    }
source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

Compute instance
```
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "${var.instance_name}"
  zone         = "${var.instance_zone}"
  machine_type = "${var.instance_type}"
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
      }
  }
  network_interface {
    network = "${var.instance_network}"
    access_config {
      # Allocate a one-to-one NAT IP to the instance
    }
  }
}
```
